Simple configuration handling
=============================

The program 'grub-mkconfig' (*note Invoking grub-mkconfig::) generates
'grub.cfg' files suitable for most cases.  It is suitable for use when
upgrading a distribution, and will discover available kernels and
attempt to generate menu entries for them.

   'grub-mkconfig' does have some limitations.  While adding extra
custom menu entries to the end of the list can be done by editing
'/etc/grub.d/40_custom' or creating '/boot/grub/custom.cfg', changing
the order of menu entries or changing their titles may require making
complex changes to shell scripts stored in '/etc/grub.d/'.  This may be
improved in the future.  In the meantime, those who feel that it would
be easier to write 'grub.cfg' directly are encouraged to do so (*note
Booting::, and *note Shell-like scripting::), and to disable any system
provided by their distribution to automatically run 'grub-mkconfig'.

   The file '/etc/default/grub' controls the operation of
'grub-mkconfig'.  It is sourced by a shell script, and so must be valid
POSIX shell input; normally, it will just be a sequence of 'KEY=value'
lines, but if the value contains spaces or other special characters then
it must be quoted.  For example:

     GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT="console serial"

   Valid keys in '/etc/default/grub' are as follows:

'GRUB_DEFAULT'
     The default menu entry.  This may be a number, in which case it
     identifies the Nth entry in the generated menu counted from zero,
     or the title of a menu entry, or the special string 'saved'.  Using
     the id may be useful if you want to set a menu entry as the default
     even though there may be a variable number of entries before it.

     For example, if you have:

     menuentry 'Example GNU/Linux distribution' --class gnu-linux --id example-gnu-linux {
     	...
     }

     then you can make this the default using:

          GRUB_DEFAULT=example-gnu-linux

     Previously it was documented the way to use entry title.  While
     this still works it's not recommended since titles often contain
     unstable device names and may be translated

     If you set this to 'saved', then the default menu entry will be
     that saved by 'GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT' or 'grub-set-default'.  This
     relies on the environment block, which may not be available in all
     situations (*note Environment block::).

     The default is '0'.

'GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT'
     If this option is set to 'true', then, when an entry is selected,
     save it as a new default entry for use by future runs of GRUB. This
     is only useful if 'GRUB_DEFAULT=saved'; it is a separate option
     because 'GRUB_DEFAULT=saved' is useful without this option, in
     conjunction with 'grub-set-default'.  Unset by default.  This
     option relies on the environment block, which may not be available
     in all situations (*note Environment block::).

'GRUB_TIMEOUT'
     Boot the default entry this many seconds after the menu is
     displayed, unless a key is pressed.  The default is '5'.  Set to
     '0' to boot immediately without displaying the menu, or to '-1' to
     wait indefinitely.

     If 'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE' is set to 'countdown' or 'hidden', the
     timeout is instead counted before the menu is displayed.

'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE'
     If this option is unset or set to 'menu', then GRUB will display
     the menu and then wait for the timeout set by 'GRUB_TIMEOUT' to
     expire before booting the default entry.  Pressing a key interrupts
     the timeout.

     If this option is set to 'countdown' or 'hidden', then, before
     displaying the menu, GRUB will wait for the timeout set by
     'GRUB_TIMEOUT' to expire.  If <ESC> or <F4> are pressed, or <SHIFT>
     is held down during that time, it will display the menu and wait
     for input.  If a hotkey associated with a menu entry is pressed, it
     will boot the associated menu entry immediately.  If the timeout
     expires before either of these happens, it will boot the default
     entry.  In the 'countdown' case, it will show a one-line indication
     of the remaining time.

'GRUB_DEFAULT_BUTTON'
'GRUB_TIMEOUT_BUTTON'
'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE_BUTTON'
'GRUB_BUTTON_CMOS_ADDRESS'
     Variants of the corresponding variables without the '_BUTTON'
     suffix, used to support vendor-specific power buttons.  *Note
     Vendor power-on keys::.

'GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR'
     Set by distributors of GRUB to their identifying name.  This is
     used to generate more informative menu entry titles.

'GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT'
     Select the terminal input device.  You may select multiple devices
     here, separated by spaces.

     Valid terminal input names depend on the platform, but may include
     'console' (native platform console), 'serial' (serial terminal),
     'serial_<port>' (serial terminal with explicit port selection),
     'at_keyboard' (PC AT keyboard), or 'usb_keyboard' (USB keyboard
     using the HID Boot Protocol, for cases where the firmware does not
     handle this).

     The default is to use the platform's native terminal input.

'GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT'
     Select the terminal output device.  You may select multiple devices
     here, separated by spaces.

     Valid terminal output names depend on the platform, but may include
     'console' (native platform console), 'serial' (serial terminal),
     'serial_<port>' (serial terminal with explicit port selection),
     'gfxterm' (graphics-mode output), 'vga_text' (VGA text output),
     'mda_text' (MDA text output), 'morse' (Morse-coding using system
     beeper) or 'spkmodem' (simple data protocol using system speaker).

     'spkmodem' is useful when no serial port is available.  Connect the
     output of sending system (where GRUB is running) to line-in of
     receiving system (usually developer machine).  On receiving system
     compile 'spkmodem-recv' from 'util/spkmodem-recv.c' and run:

          parecord --channels=1 --rate=48000 --format=s16le | ./spkmodem-recv

     The default is to use the platform's native terminal output.

'GRUB_TERMINAL'
     If this option is set, it overrides both 'GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT' and
     'GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT' to the same value.

'GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND'
     A command to configure the serial port when using the serial
     console.  *Note serial::.  Defaults to 'serial'.

'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX'
     Command-line arguments to add to menu entries for the Linux kernel.

'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT'
     Unless 'GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY' is set to 'true', two menu entries
     will be generated for each Linux kernel: one default entry and one
     entry for recovery mode.  This option lists command-line arguments
     to add only to the default menu entry, after those listed in
     'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX'.

'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_RECOVERY'
     Unless 'GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY' is set to 'true', two menu entries
     will be generated for each Linux kernel: one default entry and one
     entry for recovery mode.  This option lists command-line arguments
     to add only to the recovery menu entry, before those listed in
     'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX'.  The default is 'single'.

'GRUB_CMDLINE_NETBSD'
'GRUB_CMDLINE_NETBSD_DEFAULT'
     As 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX' and 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT', but for
     NetBSD.

'GRUB_CMDLINE_GNUMACH'
     As 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX', but for GNU Mach.

'GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN'
'GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN_DEFAULT'
     The values of these options are passed to Xen hypervisor Xen menu
     entries, for all respectively normal entries.

'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_XEN_REPLACE'
'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_XEN_REPLACE_DEFAULT'
     The values of these options replace the values of
     'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX' and 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT' for Linux and
     Xen menu entries.

'GRUB_TOP_LEVEL'
'GRUB_TOP_LEVEL_XEN'
     This option should be an absolute path to a kernel image.  If
     provided, the image specified will be made the top-level entry if
     it is found in the scan.

'GRUB_TOP_LEVEL_OS_PROBER'
     This option should be a line of output from 'os-prober'.  As
     'GRUB_TOP_LEVEL', if provided, the image specified will be made the
     top-level entry if it is found in the scan.

'GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM'
'GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_STOCK'
     List of space-separated early initrd images to be loaded from
     '/boot'.  This is for loading things like CPU microcode, firmware,
     ACPI tables, crypto keys, and so on.  These early images will be
     loaded in the order declared, and all will be loaded before the
     actual functional initrd image.

     'GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_STOCK' is for your distribution to declare
     images that are provided by the distribution.  It should not be
     modified without understanding the consequences.  They will be
     loaded first.

     'GRUB_EARLY_INITRD_LINUX_CUSTOM' is for your custom created images.

     The default stock images are as follows, though they may be
     overridden by your distribution:
          intel-uc.img intel-ucode.img amd-uc.img amd-ucode.img early_ucode.cpio microcode.cpio

'GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID'
     Normally, 'grub-mkconfig' will generate menu entries that use
     universally-unique identifiers (UUIDs) to identify the root
     filesystem to the Linux kernel, using a 'root=UUID=...' kernel
     parameter.  This is usually more reliable, but in some cases it may
     not be appropriate.  To disable the use of UUIDs, set this option
     to 'true'.

'GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID'
     If 'grub-mkconfig' cannot identify the root filesystem via its
     universally-unique indentifier (UUID), 'grub-mkconfig' can use the
     UUID of the partition containing the filesystem to identify the
     root filesystem to the Linux kernel via a 'root=PARTUUID=...'
     kernel parameter.  This is not as reliable as using the filesystem
     UUID, but is more reliable than using the Linux device names.  When
     'GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID' is set to 'false', the Linux kernel
     version must be 2.6.37 (3.10 for systems using the MSDOS partition
     scheme) or newer.  This option defaults to 'true'.  To enable the
     use of partition UUIDs, set this option to 'false'.

'GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY'
     If this option is set to 'true', disable the generation of recovery
     mode menu entries.

'GRUB_DISABLE_UUID'
     Normally, 'grub-mkconfig' will generate menu entries that use
     universally-unique identifiers (UUIDs) to identify various
     filesystems to search for files.  This is usually more reliable,
     but in some cases it may not be appropriate.  To disable this use
     of UUIDs, set this option to 'true'.  Setting this option to
     'true', will also set the options 'GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID' and
     'GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID' to 'true', unless they have been
     explicitly set to 'false'.

'GRUB_VIDEO_BACKEND'
     If graphical video support is required, either because the
     'gfxterm' graphical terminal is in use or because
     'GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX' is set, then 'grub-mkconfig' will normally
     load all available GRUB video drivers and use the one most
     appropriate for your hardware.  If you need to override this for
     some reason, then you can set this option.

     After 'grub-install' has been run, the available video drivers are
     listed in '/boot/grub/video.lst'.

'GRUB_GFXMODE'
     Set the resolution used on the 'gfxterm' graphical terminal.  Note
     that you can only use modes which your graphics card supports via
     VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE), so for example native LCD panel
     resolutions may not be available.  The default is 'auto', which
     tries to select a preferred resolution.  *Note gfxmode::.

'GRUB_BACKGROUND'
     Set a background image for use with the 'gfxterm' graphical
     terminal.  The value of this option must be a file readable by GRUB
     at boot time, and it must end with '.png', '.tga', '.jpg', or
     '.jpeg'.  The image will be scaled if necessary to fit the screen.
     Image height and width will be restricted by an artificial limit of
     16384.

'GRUB_THEME'
     Set a theme for use with the 'gfxterm' graphical terminal.

'GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX'
     Set to 'text' to force the Linux kernel to boot in normal text
     mode, 'keep' to preserve the graphics mode set using
     'GRUB_GFXMODE', 'WIDTHxHEIGHT'['xDEPTH'] to set a particular
     graphics mode, or a sequence of these separated by commas or
     semicolons to try several modes in sequence.  *Note gfxpayload::.

     Depending on your kernel, your distribution, your graphics card,
     and the phase of the moon, note that using this option may cause
     GNU/Linux to suffer from various display problems, particularly
     during the early part of the boot sequence.  If you have problems,
     set this option to 'text' and GRUB will tell Linux to boot in
     normal text mode.

'GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER'
     The 'grub-mkconfig' has a feature to use the external 'os-prober'
     program to discover other operating systems installed on the same
     machine and generate appropriate menu entries for them.  It is
     disabled by default since automatic and silent execution of
     'os-prober', and creating boot entries based on that data, is a
     potential attack vector.  Set this option to 'false' to enable this
     feature in the 'grub-mkconfig' command.

'GRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST'
     List of space-separated case insensitive UUIDs of filesystems to be
     ignored from os-prober output.  For EFI chainloaders it's
     <UUID>@<EFI FILE>.  For backward compatibility with previous
     behaviour, <UUID>@/dev/* is also accepted for non-EFI chainloaders
     even if the device does not match, and comma and semicolon are also
     accepted as separator.

'GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU'
     Normally, 'grub-mkconfig' will generate top level menu entry for
     the kernel with highest version number and put all other found
     kernels or alternative menu entries for recovery mode in submenu.
     For entries returned by 'os-prober' first entry will be put on top
     level and all others in submenu.  If this option is set to 'true',
     flat menu with all entries on top level will be generated instead.
     Changing this option will require changing existing values of
     'GRUB_DEFAULT', 'fallback' (*note fallback::) and 'default' (*note
     default::) environment variables as well as saved default entry
     using 'grub-set-default' and value used with 'grub-reboot'.

'GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK'
     If set to 'y', 'grub-mkconfig' and 'grub-install' will check for
     encrypted disks and generate additional commands needed to access
     them during boot.  Note that in this case unattended boot is not
     possible because GRUB will wait for passphrase to unlock encrypted
     container.

'GRUB_INIT_TUNE'
     Play a tune on the speaker when GRUB starts.  This is particularly
     useful for users unable to see the screen.  The value of this
     option is passed directly to *note play::.

'GRUB_BADRAM'
     If this option is set, GRUB will issue a *note badram:: command to
     filter out specified regions of RAM.

'GRUB_PRELOAD_MODULES'
     This option may be set to a list of GRUB module names separated by
     spaces.  Each module will be loaded as early as possible, at the
     start of 'grub.cfg'.

   The following options are still accepted for compatibility with
existing configurations, but have better replacements:

'GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT'
     Wait this many seconds before displaying the menu.  If <ESC> or
     <F4> are pressed, or <SHIFT> is held down during that time, display
     the menu and wait for input according to 'GRUB_TIMEOUT'.  If a
     hotkey associated with a menu entry is pressed, boot the associated
     menu entry immediately.  If the timeout expires before either of
     these happens, display the menu for the number of seconds specified
     in 'GRUB_TIMEOUT' before booting the default entry.

     If you set 'GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT', you should also set
     'GRUB_TIMEOUT=0' so that the menu is not displayed at all unless
     <ESC> or <F4> are pressed, or <SHIFT> is held down.

     This option is unset by default, and is deprecated in favour of the
     less confusing 'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown' or
     'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden'.

'GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET'
     In conjunction with 'GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT', set this to 'true' to
     suppress the verbose countdown while waiting for a key to be
     pressed before displaying the menu.

     This option is unset by default, and is deprecated in favour of the
     less confusing 'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown'.

'GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_BUTTON'
     Variant of 'GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT', used to support vendor-specific
     power buttons.  *Note Vendor power-on keys::.

     This option is unset by default, and is deprecated in favour of the
     less confusing 'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown' or
     'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden'.

   For more detailed customisation of 'grub-mkconfig''s output, you may
edit the scripts in '/etc/grub.d' directly.  '/etc/grub.d/40_custom' is
particularly useful for adding entire custom menu entries; simply type
the menu entries you want to add at the end of that file, making sure to
leave at least the first two lines intact.
