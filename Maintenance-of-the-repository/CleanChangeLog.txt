I just decided that from now on, days will get longer in the northern
  hemisphere :)
Other highlights:
- gcc-* have been migrated from Slackware, to allow building the latest
  kernel.
- The kernel-* packages have been to upgraded to version 6.18.2 (new
  LTS branch. As a reminder, after upgrade and you have checked that the
  machine runs OK with the new kernel, to save space on disk you can
  types as root: clean-kernels to remove the not in use ones.
  During the update, as both grub and the kernel are upgraded,
  update-grub will run twice. This should be harmless.
- A new package named transcript is provided. it allows to download and
  convert to text the audio of a video just typing:
  transcript <url>
  This will take some (read: a long) time, be patient. When done, the
  text will be available in the directory from which you typed comand,
  aptly named transcript.txt.
  Technically the script transcript relies on yt-dlp, ffmpeg, pip and
  the faster-whisper engine from OpenAI. It runs in a virtual environment
  in your home directory, the first time you run it the script you will
  tell how to set it up, which just needs to type one command.
  I hope that some will find this useful, feedback welcome.
- Under the hood, the layout of packages in the repository has changed.
  The main directory has been renamed from "slint" to "packages".
  All packages previously stored in the sub-directories extra, lxqt,
  matchbox and mate are now stored directly in packages
  Now in packages each of the sub-directories lxqt, matchbox, mate
  and slint contains a single "dummy" package, that contains only its
  description but is associated to a .dep file listing all packages in
  the set. This allows an easier maintenance, as indicated below.
- There is no more an i3 set of packages but one can still install i3,
  i3status and I38, which will pull their dependencies.
- Now the shortcut Ctrl+Q quits Firefox also from kiosk.

This batch provides:
- LXQt upgraded to version 2.3.0, that can now run not only on an X
  server but also on Wayland, thanks to Frank Honolka as usual.
- An accessible kiosk, based on the cage application, accessible and
  running on Wayland, that should come handy for people preferring to
  use the CLI aka text mode but occasionally need to run a single
  graphical application like for instance firefox. 
- Various fixes and enhancements of the Matchbox graphical environment.
- Additional and updated packages in the Wayland area needed by LXQt and
  cage, also prepared by Frank.
- The plank dock has been updated and now live on the left of the screen
  by default. An application docklet can be included in the dock.
== How to update your system ==
- To get all new packages that should be installed by default as updated
  ones, type as root or using sudo:
  slapt-get -u
  slapt-get --upgrade
  slapt-get --install-set slint
- To update and complete the LXQt set of packages:
  slapt-get --install-set lxqt
== New features and reminders ==
- To start LXQt on X, either type session-chooser lxqt then startx from
  a tty or select it from lightdm.
- For now LXQt on Wayland can be started only from a tty, typing:
  startlxqtwayland
- To start a graphical application in the kiosk, from a tty type:
  kiosk <application and options or arguments>
  For instance:
  kiosk firefox https://slint.fr
  Closing the application will get you back to the tty from which it was
  started.
  If you enabled orca typing orca-on before starting the kiosk the
  graphical application started in the kiosk will be accessible with
  braille and speech.
- For Matchbox usage, after installation read:
  /usr/doc/matchbox/README.Slint
  The default key bindings are set in /etc/matchbox/kbdconfig
- To set key bindings for the lbwc compositot, Frank suggests to first
  copy /usr/doc/labwc/rc.xml.all to $HOME/.config/labwc/rc.xml, the edit
  $HOME/.config/labwc/rc.xml to your liking.

Sun Nov 16 00:00:00 UTC 2025
This batch of updates provides:
- an additional desktop: matchbox
- an update of yt-dlp, that has needed to provide new dependencies,
  namely the deno javascript engine, yt-dlp-ejs and their dependencies.
- new kernel packages, microcodes for AMD and Intel CPU, firmware
== Note about matchbox ==
You can get it just typing as root or using sudo:
slapt-get -u
then:
slapt-get -i matchbox-window-manager # will pull all dependencies
or:
slapt-get --install-set matchbox
After that you can start matchbox:
- From a console typing "session-chooser matchbox" then "startx"
- From lightdm just choosing it upon login
To know more, read:
- the comments in /etc/matchbox/kbdconfig
- the comments in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.matchbox or after having typed
  session-matchbox in ~/.xinitrc
- for the history of matchbox this document:
  /usr/doc/matchbox/matchbox-manual.html
  It is 20 years old, but matchbox has not changed much since then.
There would be a lot more to say, but I don't want to delay even more
this batch of updates that also contains the latest yt-dlp, else Rudy
would hate me :)
Meanwhile, questions suggestions and bug reports are welcome, as always.

Fri Sep 26 00:00:00 UTC 2025
NOTES:
1. This batch of updates provides gTTS, the Google Text-to-speech software and
   its build and run time dependencies. Just type: gtts-cli
   The python3-gTTS package also includes "saythis", wrapper script to gTTS
   that allows to speak a sentence or the text in a file. Examples:
   saythis "Slint is my preferred Linux distribution."
   saythis -f <some text file>
   For help, just type: saythis or saythis -h
   WARNING for Orca users: edit as root the file:
   /etc/speech-dispatcher/speehcd.conf
   replacing if it exists this line:
   AudioOutputMethod "libao"
   by this one:
   AudioOutputMethod "pulse".
   Otherwise saythis will not work if Orca is running.
2. yt-dlp and as consequence pipe-viewer suffer from an issue with YouTube,
   preventing  to downloading YouTube videos.
   Workaround if using yt-dlp directly: include in the command this option:
   --extractor-args "youtube:player-client=default,-tv_simply"
   If using pipe-viewer, type (mind the simple and double quotes):
   pipe-viewer --ytdl-cmd='/usr/bin/yt-dlp --extractor-args "youtube:player-client=default,-tv_simply"'

This updates provides:
- an update of the Orca screen reader
- two new graphical terminals: kitty and wezterm as well as their
  dependencies
- the TUI web and file browser chawan, best started in kitty or wezterm
  to allow displaying images.
As kitty, wezterm and chawan are in /extra, install them like this after
having run slapt-get -u: slapt-get -i <pakage name>, for instance:
slapt-get -i chawan.
-- Introducing chawan --
Chawan is both a TUI web browser and a local files browser
It can display images and has some javascript support, and run in a
graphical terminal or in a Linux console or tty.
If started in kitty or wezterm it allows to display images, which can be
toggled on or off as javascript handling. Examples:
cha displays a short help
cha -V display the key bindings
cha slint.fr allows to visit Slint's websie
cha /usr/doc/chawan-0.2.2/ displays the content of its documentation
  directory
cha . displays the content of the current directory
In a graphical terminal only, right click raises a contextual menu.
Caveat: chawan is not accessible in a graphical terminal like kitty or
wezterm, but it can run in a Linux console (aka tty) where a screen
reader is running. Then the page or file can be spoken and most key
binding work, which should allow to access at least some web sites with
javascript enabled. You will find the default keybindings in:
/usr/doc/chawan-0.2.2/chawan_keybindings.txt

  This package is a copy of slapt-get-0.11.11-x86_64-4slint.txz
  It is included only as a dependency of the kernel package, so that when
  running slapt-get --upgrade if a kernel and slapt-get should both be upgraded
  slapt-get should be upgraded before the new kernel is installed.

This batch of updates provides the LXQt 2.1.0 desktop, thanks for his great
work to Frank Honolka.

It also provides a rebuilt slapt-get allowing to remove obsolete packages:
Quoting "man slapt-get" after its update:
       --remove-obsolete
              Remove  installed  packages  that are no longer available.  This
              works for --dist-upgrade only. This removes packages that are no
              longer  available from any current package sources, but are cur‐
              rently installed.  Be careful as this will  also  remove  custom
              built  packages as well as packages coming from a repository not
              enabled in /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.  Always use it  with  the
              -s option first to check what would be removed.
So to remove obsolete packages type as root:
slapt-get --dist-upgrade --remove-obsolete s
Carefully review the list of packages that would be reviewed before going
further. Be aware that if you enabled a repository, intsalles packages from it
then disabled it, the command above will propose to remove all packages from
this repository, if not available from another one.
If you agree with the list,  run the command above without the -s option or
remove only the packages you want to get rid of running for each of them
removepkg <package name>
or
spkg -d <package name>

About LXQt:
first run as usual and as root:
slapt-get -u
slapt-get --upgrade
dotnew (or dotnew-gtk)

If you want to get the LXQt desktop and associated applications, then type as
root or using sudo and preferably in a console (in text mode):
slapt-get --install-set lxqt

Then to use it type as regular user:
session-chooser lxqt
Be aware that in the lightdm greeter the default session will still be mate
for now, so you will need to change it at time of log in. Alternatively use
login-chooser to start in text mode then type startx to start LXQt.
Caveat: LXQt is not as accessible as MATE for blind users.

If you have installed and used a previous version of LXQt, to update its
appearance type as regular user:
cd
rm -r .config/lxqt
rm -r .config/pcmanfmqt

  Modify /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/10.slint-appearance.gschema.override
  to append a line with: reader=false to the slick-greeter
  In the upcoming new Slint installer, if speech was used during installation
  this will be replaced by : reader=true so that Orca be active in lightdm by
  default.
Several packages have been moved from the main repository to extra as they
will not be installed by default any more. This will avoid that typing
"slapt-get --install-set slint" installs them as they will be soon removed
from the repository. They are listed in:

This batch of updates upgrades kernel-* packages.
WARNING: the new kernel can reorder the sound cards as listed by:
  list-cards
  For instance here card 1 was PCH using the previous kernel, bus is now
  HDMI using the new kernel.
  To make sure you use the right card for your console screen reader write as
  root ALSA_CARD=PCH in these files if they exist after upgrade:
  /etc/espeakup.conf
  /etc/fenrir.conf
  You may also want to edit (or remove if you want to continue using the
  previous kernel as a backup) the file /etc/asound.conf
This batch of updates also brings open-jtalk-voice-jp, a Japanese male
  voice for the Open Jtalk TTS, also added and associated dependencies.
  This voice and its dependencies are in extra.
  To install all these packages at once, type as root or using sudo:
  slapt-get -u
  then:
  slapt-get -i open-jtalk-voice-jp
  Then it will become available also for fenrir, Orca and Cthulhu: in
  the Preferences GUI of Orca or Cthulhu, in the Voice tab, just choose
  openjtalk as speech-synthesizer and the jp language.
  Important: as I don't speak Japanese at all, feedback from users who
  do is warmly welcome.
NOTE: to get the upgraded or rebuilt packages, type as root or using sudo:
slapt-get -u
slapt-get --upgrade
dotnew (or dotnew-gtk)

xinit-1.4.2-x86_64-1slint.txz: Upgraded.
  This release contains a bug fix: now when running startx an xauth
  authorisation file is created in /tmp. This avoids displaying an error
  message like this one:
  xauth: file /home/didier/.serverauth.1090 does not exist
  A new script newstartx is also provided. Typing newstartx has the same
  effect as typing startx, with one exception: instead of connecting the
  graphical session to the first available console, it connects to the
  console where newstartx was run.
  For example, assuming a default /etc/fstab (6 consoles open at startup),
  typing newstartx from tty1 will connect the graphical sessions to tty1,
  instead of tty7.
  For some (still unknown to me) reason this also allows to change the
  time settings from the Clock applet of the Mate panel (via Preferences
  after right-clicking on the applet), just like when starting the Mate
  from lightdm. However, the time settings are instead disabled if the
  session was started by typing startx. I would be grateful for an
  explanation of this discrepancy - Didier.

NOTE
A very huge batch of updates will be provided soon. It is expected to be
applied without issue, however you may want to make a backup of your Slint
system (possibly minus the /home directory that will not be modified)
before applying the incoming updates.
Alternatively if the btrfs filesystem has been used to install Slint (this
is the case if Slint has been installed in "auto" partitioning mode or
if btrfs has been chosen when installing in "manual" partitioning mode)
you can use the absm utility to make a snapshot of the / subvolume before
applying the upcoming updates. Then please upgrade absm before running
it as the upgraded package shipped today contains important fixes and
enhancements
--
absm-2.0-noarch-1slint.txz: Upgraded.
  If specs are not met the user acknowledge the error message before exiting.
  Include absm.desktop to allow starting from a graphical menu.
  Allow editing the typed description.

To install it, un-comment and modify in /etc/slat-get/slapt-getrc this line:
# SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/gfs/15.0/41.10/x86_64/:OFFICIAL
so it becomes:
SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/gfs/15.0/41.10/x86_64/:PREFERRED
To uninstall it comment out the same line, then type:
slapt-get -u
cd /var/lib/pkgtools/packages

Then to get back the Slint packages that had been replaced by some from the
gnome set when installing it, type:
slapt-get --install-set slint
The following packages are included as a temporary replacement of some
from the gfs repository that have linking issues. They are tagged gfs not
slint, so they can be removed with other packages of this set. I will
remove them from our repository when these issues will have been fixed.

News:
1. This batch of updates provides the ability to load early microcode
for Intel and AMD CPU, as stated for instance in:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/x86/microcode.txt
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/microcode
We will, use the method mentioned under 1.2.2.2 GRUB. the new file
/boot/grub/grub.cfg written by update-grub after a kernel upgrade will
include a line similar to this one:
 initrd	/@/boot/intel-ucode.img /@/boot/amd-ucode.img /@/boot/initramfs-6.1.55.img
This will load the iniramfs carrying the microcode for Intel and AMD CPUs early.
2. From now on we will avoid to ship in Slint packages already available in the
repository extra-15.0 provided by Geage Vlahavas, Salix maintainer:
including this line in /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc
#  SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/salix/x86_64/extra-15.0/

 To avoid that it be replaced by the regular orca package when running
 slapt-get --upgrade, blacklist it in /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc
 To reinstall the regular package, type:

  Remind will be a dependency of the new version of I38, soon to be
  released by Storm and packaged for Slint.
  WARNING: to successfully install remind and some of its dependencies you will

#  SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/salix/x86_64/extra-15.0/:OFFICIAL
  removing "# " at the beginning of the line
  then type as root or using sudo:
  slapt-get -u

   (this document from Debian applies also to Slint).

slapt-get-0.11.8-x86_64-5slint.txz: Rebuilt.
  Changes:
  1. Include the option --no-early-microcode to the dracut command
  run after a kernel upgrade. Instead GRUB will load the microcode early.
  2. Enable by default for new users this repository:
  SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/salix/x86_64/extra-15.0/:OFFICIAL
  as it includes dependencies of the new package remind not available
  in a Slint repository.
slapt-src-git6dd64bb-x86_64-1slint.txz: Upgraded.
  This upgrade adds a -S or --skip-installed option. Quote from "slapt-src --help":
  -S, --skip-installable skip if available via slapt-get, applicable only to --upgrade-all
slint-user-settings-15.0-noarch-7slint.txz: Rebuilt.
  Changes:
  1. New users will get in their ~/.profile file these lines:
export GROFF_ENCODING=UTF-8
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/run/user/$(id -u)
export XDG_RUNTIME_HOME=/run/user/$(id -u)
chmod 700 /run/user/$(id -u)
mkdir -p $HOME/.ccache
  Existing users can just include their line in their ~/.profile (the first one
  should already exist).
  The goal is to write the files in ~/.cache in RAM, to avoid useless writes on
  disk.
  2. Set by default the session as "mate", to avoid that new users typing "startx"
  without having set the graphical session using the session-chooser utility just
  get a blank screen with an xterm.

Most of the updates in this batch are triggered by the upgrade of ffmpeg from version 4.4.2 to 5.1.2.
As many packages depend on it, most coming from Slackware 15.0, I decided to include them in the
Slint repository, rebuilt against the new ffmpeg, some upgraded on this occasion. In the list below
I mention a short description of only the added packages not migrated from Slackware. The packages
mentioned as Upgraded instead were already in the Slint repository.
Caveat: 4 packages that could not be rebuilt against the new ffmpeg will not work any more.
I recommend that you remove them already from your system. They are marked Removed below.
audacious: Removed
audacious-plugins: Removed.
libquicktime: Removed
QtAV: Removed.
Also qt5 is now shipped without the web engine.
To update your system, as usual type as root or using sudo:
slapt-get -u
slapt-get --install-set slint # to get the package really added
slapt-get --upgrade
dotnew

This batch of updates coincides and is coordinated with the publication of this release candidate ISO:
https://slackware.uk/slint/x86_64/slint-15.0/iso/slint64-15.0rc2.iso
If you have already installed using the previous ISO labeled slint64-15.0rc.iso you do not need to
reinstall, but to update your system simply download this file:
https://slackware.uk/slint/x86_64/slint-15.0/update-from-rc
then read it and run it as a shell script, simply typing as root or using sudo:
sh update-from-rc

The official release of slint 15.0, which will only bring a few packages additions and updates,
will occur in a few days to coincide with the update of the Slint website to present
the new version and give an easy access to the HandBook in all available languages, currently:
English, Dutch, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Swedish.

The HandBook and its translations will be updated as needed, both in the website and in installed
systems updating the package slint-docs.

House cleaning...
Note:
To update your system type as root or using sudo the three commands below:
slapt-get -u
slapt-get --upgrade
removepkg libgksu # or: spkg -d libgksu
removepkg mps-youtube # or: spkg -d mps-youtube
The third and fourth commands are needed because in Slint slapt-get can not remove from
your system packages removed from the repository.
extra/eukleides-1.5.4-x86_64-1slint.txz: Added.
  Computer language devoted to elementary plane geometry.
--
mps-youtube-0.2.8-x86_64-3slint.txz: Removed.

  This package only (re)creates the symlinks in /usr/bin created by installing gnsu:

  case occurring replacing the unsafe gksu binary by a symlink.
+-------------------------+
Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 UTC 2022
Note:
The packages added in this batch are "dummy" packages to overcome discrepancies between their
names in this repository and in the repository extra-15.0, to avoid that a package be installed
from the extra-15.0 repository although available in Slint.
In that aim theses packages' names are those in extra-15.0 but each mentions as dependency the
name of the same package in the slint-15.0 repository.

Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 UTC 2022
Note:
This batch of updates is coordinated with the release of the new ISO slint64-15.0rc
All packages removed from the main /slint repository but catfish can still be installed
using slapt-get, provided that theses lines be included in /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc:
SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/salix/x86_64/extra-15.0/:OFFICIAL
SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/salix/x86_64/slackware-15.0/:OFFICIAL
SOURCE=https://slackware.uk/slint/x86_64/slint-15.0/:PREFERRED
The removal of packages have two aims:
1. Decrease the size of a just installed system and incidentally the size of the ISO.
2. Decrease the cluttering of applications menus of the graphical environments.
Other packages, not listed below as they come from a Slackware repository, are removed from
the ISO thus will not be included by default but can still be installed using slapt-get,
provided that this line be included in /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc:

Sint64-15.0beta3.iso is available in:
https://slackware.uk/slint/x86_64/slint-15.0/iso/
This ISO wheighs 4527839232, so should fit in a DVD.
In this aim I have removed big packages that can be installed later, or
are useless in Slint context, namely: mkinitrd (supersed by dracut),
elilo and lilo (superseded by GRUB), slackpkg (we use slapt-get),
slacktrack, seamonkey, accountsservice, geequie, rust, zuku-openjdk and
fluid-soundfont.
Now the choice of desktop made at end of installation will be effective
after a reboot on all starting modes: console and graphical. This should
avoid that users who need speech or braille land in an inaccessible
graphical environments - unless they chose it, of course.
At end of installation all data that could help investigate are stored
in a compressed archive named INSTALLER.xz, that can be attached to an
email to help investigating issues like no Internet connection or no
sound or speech. These data include the file syslog where all messages
from the kernel or userspace applications relying on syslogd are written.
This also free /dev/tty4, where these messages were previously sent so
users have one more tty at hand.

Other updates:
accountsservice-22.08.8-x86_64-1slint.txz: Removed
  This package was a dependency of sddm, now removed, and an optional
  dependency of lightdm, however simpler to manage without it.
slint-control-center-15.0-noarch-2slint: added a .desktop file to
  display a preview of the GRUB boot menu
slint-misc-15.0-noarch-1slint.txz: Removed.
  It just installed ascript to make a rescue boot stick, now enhanced
  and shipped in the package slint-scripts.
slint-scripts-15.0-noarch-3slint.txz: Rebuilt.
  Scripts added: /usr/sbin/gmen (wrapper to help start list_boot_entries
  from the Slint control center) and list_boot_entries.
  Scripts removed: desktop-add and desktop-remove.
  Scripts modified: switch-on (The choice of voxin as TTS if emacspeak
  is chosen is effective, not sure it was before a shellcheck found an
  error) that I fixed,
  display-desktop and hide-desktop (scope limited to mate and lxqt)
  session-chooser: rely only on .dmrc to recod the user session for
  lightm, as I have removed the script user_xsession.py that relied on
  accountsservice as noted in:
  https://afrantzis.com/posts/changing-gdm-lightdm-user-login-settings-programmatically/

and supersedes Sint64-15.0beta.iso
The main installation script of the installer has been edited to fix
most bugs discovered in the previous version, and help investigate the
the reported issue that the installer speaks on some machines but not
others, or only using a DVD to install.
