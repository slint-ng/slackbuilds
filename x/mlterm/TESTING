Why mlterm?

mlterm provides uniques features, among which:
_ It can properly display nearly all languages, including CJK, and 
  complex scripts like a mix of Arabic or Persian (written right to left)
  and English (written left to right).
_ It can be used as a terminal for X as well as a framebuffer terminal,
  using the same fonts, possibly antialiased. This should allow to use
  it in a text only installer, or in a system without an X server, while
  keeping most features available under X.
_ It can also be used in a terminal fr Wayland (not tested by me).
_ It provides a configuration GUI under X (accessible with a right mouse
  click while holding the [Ctrl] key) and a GUI to quicly change settings
  of the runing terminal (accessible with a left mouse click, holding the
  [Ctrl] key).
_ It provides a semi-graphical configuration UI in a framebuffer: mlcc
_ It can handle the mouse in a framebuffer (not using gpm). For instance
  this gives access to the menu of the mled editor with the mouse.
