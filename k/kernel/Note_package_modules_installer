# The package modules-installer is used only during installation and as such
# should be stored in http://slackware.uk/slint/x86_64/slint-15.0/slint/installer/
# It should be updated follwing each and every update of the kernel package
# After having built a kernel and put it under ../../slint,
# run build_modules-installer; then type:
rm -f ../../packages/installer/modules-installer*
mv modules-installer*txz ../../packages/installer
# Or just: sh Note_package_modules_installer
