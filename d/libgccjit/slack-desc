# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libgccjit: libgccit (Just In Time Compilation: shared library and header files.)
libgccjit:
libgccjit: GCC can be built as a shared library "libgccjit.so", for generating 
libgccjit: machine code from API calls, using GCC as the backend.
libgccjit: This shared library can then be dynamically-linked into bytecode
libgccjit: interpreters and other such programs that want to generate machine
libgccjit: code "on the fly" at run-time. It can also be used for ahead-of-time 
libgccjit: code generation, for building standalone compilers (so the "jit"
libgccjit: part of the name is now something of a misnomer).
libgccjit: The library provides a C API, along with a C++ wrapper API, with 
libgccjit: bindings for languages available from 3rd parties
