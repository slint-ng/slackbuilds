Review of DAE digital audio editor


To Do:
- fix rewinding
- add copyright 
- for less confusion between Python and Perl DAE, mv dae dae.perl or dae.pl
- problem when using python2.5 (no longer packaged) not finding pyeca. 
  Solved forcing python2.6. Fix the dae script to invoke python, not python2.5
- problem using dae under a graphical console command prompt. The function keys
   F1 etc are not caught, all receive 0 or start another app. 
   Add this to documentation, that DAE must be run
   from a non-graphical shell terminal environment. (e.g. ctrl-alt-2)
- pickafile: line 52: getterm: command not found

Known bugs:
- mp3 not fully supported
- ogg not fully supported

Tests

1- play wav file PASS
2- dae without argument PASS (unknow created)
3- running from graphical console prompt (FAIL, catchkey)
4- preference directory ~/.kies/
5- record on empty file (demo works but Python 1.6 fails)
6- insert from wav file (fails)

Outputs




Problem 6

Problem:
When recording (F10) or inserting from wav file (F11):
DAE gets stuck

Error Message:
Exception AttributeError: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'maxint'" in <bound method Popen3.__del__ of <popen2.Popen3 instance at 0x..... >> ignored

Suggestion:
Probably a python 1.6 depreciation problem of the library


Problem 5

Problem:
It works but complains when writing block

Error message:
pyeca Respone Lengh Error, Received 23, expected for 0.





Created new wav using gnome-sound-recorder

Problem 2a

Can't locate Audio/Ecasound.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /home/guillaume/dev/python/dae/blib/arch /home/guillaume/dev/python/dae/blib/lib /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.1 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1 /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/perl/5.10 /usr/share/perl/5.10 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) at svnDAE/dae line 20.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at svnDAE/dae line 20.

Solution 2a

Do not run dae or ./dae from the root directory of DAE.
The file named ./dae is the Perl version which is not founctional
Instead, you must you dae.py
The way to use dae.py is to add it to the PATH as dae.

If you added the whole folder DAE to the path, then
mv dae dae.pl
cp dae.py dae
Otherwise, 
sudo cp dae.py /usr/bin/dae

Problem 2b

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./dae", line 2, in <module>
    from pyeca import *
ImportError: No module named pyeca

Solution 2b

dae forces python2.5 which doesn't find the shared python libraries
running dae with python 2.6 or your system default does it:

python dae
or
python 2.6 dae
or
python dae.py



import pyeca


Check package python-ecasound2.2 is installed
sudo apt-get install python-ecasound2.2

/usr/share/pyshared/pyeca.py
/usr/share/pyshared/ecacontrol.py
/usr/share/pyshared/eci.py
/usr/share/python-support/python-ecasound2.2.public

exporting PYTHONPATH with the values from
/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.5/.path
works around that.
sys.path.append("/path/to/markdown_parent")
import markdown2

export PATH=

Requirements:
- Python 2.5
- ecasound

Installation process

1. apt-get install ecasound
2. svn co http://goblin.icomtek.csir.co.za/svn/dae/trunk/ DAE
 (locally)

A    svnDAE/dae.py
A    svnDAE/audioeditor.txt
A    svnDAE/pickafile

A    svnDAE/dae
A    svnDAE/Term-Screen-ReadLine-0.33.tar.gz
A    svnDAE/catchkey
A    svnDAE/README

3. Python
4. Copy catchkey and pickafile into your exec path
   export PATH=YourAbsolutePathToDAE:$PATH
if in directory:
export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH

Using Dae

dae sound.wav

Problem 3
Running DAE from a graphical console
Solution 3
Disactivate / Reassign keyboard shortcuts for the terminal console

Problem4
pickafile: line 52: getterm: command not found
cannot cancel

Problem 1
