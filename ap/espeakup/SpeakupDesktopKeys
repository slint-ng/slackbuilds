Almost all keys listed below are located on the numeric keypad. 
The Insert or 0 key on the keypad acts like a shift key. For instance,
Ins 2 means "hold down the Insert key like a shift key and press 2".
Keep numlock off to use Speakup. 

Scope: these key bindings can be used with hard synthesizers and with
espeakup, and also with speechd-up. However setting the pitch or the
speech volume using key bindings is not available when using speechd-up. 

First keys to remember:
PrintScreen     Toggle speakup on/off 
Ins F1          Speakup Help (press Space to exit the help)

Keys used to change settings:
Ins 1/2         Decrease/Increase the sound volume
Ins 3/4         Decrease/increase the pitch
Ins 5/6         Decrease/Increase the speech rate
Ins F9/F10      Decrease/Increase the punctuation level
ins F11/F12     Decrease/Increase the reading punctuation

These settings can be saved typing as root:
speakup-save
The settings for a hard synthesizer, speechd-up or espeakup are saved
separately as they can differ.

Then they will be restored at next start of espeakup, speechd-up or at
next boot for a hard synthesizer.

If you don't to want to restore the saved settings, type as root:
