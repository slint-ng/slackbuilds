1. Clone the barnard repository.
2. Create a tmp directory inside the repo.
3. Download the Go 1.25.6 linux amd64 tarball from the Go
  downloads page and extract it into the tmp directory.
4. Build using the Go binary from the tmp directory:
  GOROOT=/path/to/tmp/go /path/to/tmp/go/bin/go build
5. Copy the resulting barnard binary into this package directory.
