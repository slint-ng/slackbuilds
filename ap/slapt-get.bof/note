This is a dummy package to force installation of aaa_slapt_get first,
so before a kernel, kernel-source or kernel headers package.

In that aim the dependency file slapt-get*dep should contain following line:
aaa_slapt-get

But that doesn't seem to work so we will just a week or so before uploading
a new kernel:(
