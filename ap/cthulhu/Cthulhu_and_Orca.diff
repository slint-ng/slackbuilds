 # Orca and Cthulhu: When to use each
 
-Cthulhu is a fork of Orca, developed with a focus on lightweight environments, greater flexibility, and an inclusive development community. Both screen readers provide critical accessibility tools for visually impaired users, but they cater to slightly different needs and workflows.

-### Target Environments  
-- **Orca**: Optimized for full-featured desktop environments like Gnome or Mate, especially where newer features like sleep mode (to silence Orca temporarily) are important.  
-- **Cthulhu**: Ideal for lightweight desktop environments or standalone window managers such as the I3 project, where performance and compatibility with simpler setups are prioritized.

+### Application Compatibility
 - **Cthulhu**: Works well with Mozilla based applications, e.g. Firefox and Thunderbird as well as with some older QT applications such as qjoypad. Those using Orca with Gnome or Mate should not have any problems with Firefox or Thunderbird, but light weight Window managers such as I3 struggle with Orca and those applications.
 
-### Plugin Support  
-- **Orca**: Relies on built-in functionality and GNOME-aligned development.  
-- **Cthulhu**: Offers two plugin systems:  
-  - **libpeas** for traditional, structured plugin development.  
-  - A simple, versatile system supporting scripts written in almost any language (e.g., Bash), allowing developers to implement custom features with minimal overhead.

-### Development Philosophy  
-- **Orca**: Developed within the GNOME project, with changes and contributions primarily aligned to GNOMEâroadmap.  
-- **Cthulhu**: Encourages a more open and collaborative development process, welcoming contributions and customization from users and developers alike.
