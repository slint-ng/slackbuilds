Cthulhu is a screen reader for individuals who are blind or visually impaired,
forked from Orca. It provides access to applications and toolkits that support
the AT-SPI (e.g., the GNOME desktop).

This screen reader helps users navigate their desktop environment and applications
through speech synthesis and braille output.

After installation, you can start Cthulhu through the GNOME desktop environment
or by running 'cthulhu' from the command line.
