<h1 id="orca-and-cthulhu-when-to-use-each">Orca and Cthulhu: When to use
each</h1>
<p>Cthulhu is a fork of Orca, developed with a focus on lightweight
environments, greater flexibility, and an inclusive development
community. Both screen readers provide critical accessibility tools for
visually impaired users, but they cater to slightly different needs and
workflows.</p>
<p>In Mate to toggle between Orca and Cthukhu press Shift-Alt-v.</p>
<h2 id="key-differences">Key Differences</h2>
<h3 id="target-environments">Target Environments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orca</strong>: Optimized for full-featured desktop
environments like Gnome or Mate, especially where newer features like
sleep mode (to silence Orca temporarily) are important.</li>
<li><strong>Cthulhu</strong>: Ideal for lightweight desktop environments
or standalone window managers such as the I3 project, where performance
and compatibility with simpler setups are prioritized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application-compatibility">Application Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cthulhu</strong>: Works well with Mozilla based
applications, e.g. Firefox and Thunderbird as well as with some older QT
applications such as qjoypad. Those using Orca with Gnome or Mate should
not have any problems with Firefox or Thunderbird, but light weight
Window managers such as I3 struggle with Orca and those
applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plugin-support">Plugin Support</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orca</strong>: Relies on built-in functionality and
GNOME-aligned development.</li>
<li><strong>Cthulhu</strong>: Offers two plugin systems:
<ul>
<li><strong>libpeas</strong> for traditional, structured plugin
development.</li>
<li>A simple, versatile system supporting scripts written in almost any
language (e.g., Bash), allowing developers to implement custom features
with minimal overhead.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development-philosophy">Development Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orca</strong>: Developed within the GNOME project, with
changes and contributions primarily aligned to GNOME roadmap.</li>
<li><strong>Cthulhu</strong>: Encourages a more open and collaborative
development process, welcoming contributions and customization from
users and developers alike.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-should-use-orca">Who Should Use Orca?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users in Feature-Rich Desktop Environments</strong>: Orca
shines in GNOME or other full desktops such as KDE or Mate.</li>
<li><strong>General Users</strong>: Those who prefer stability and
alignment with GNOME official updates and features. Those who do not
want to use rapidly changing, bleeding edge code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-should-use-cthulhu">Who Should Use Cthulhu?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Lightweight Desktop or Window Manager Users</strong>: If
you are using minimal environments like Xfce, LXQt, or a tiling window
manager, Cthulhu will be more compatible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mozilla Application Users</strong>: For those relying
heavily on Firefox and Thunderbird, Cthulhu provides superior
performance and interaction in lightweight or non-standard
setups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developers and Tinkerers</strong>: Cthulhu is perfect for
those interested in writing plugins, as it supports both structured
development via libpeas and rapid, versatile scripting in languages like
Bash. Contributions to the code are welcome and in fact
encouraged.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Orca and Cthulhu are complementary tools, each excelling in different
contexts. It is perfectly fine to switch between the 2 screen readers
during your daily workflow. In fact, the I38 project has a dedicated
keyboard shortcut to switch between the active screen reader.</p>
