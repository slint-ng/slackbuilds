These key bindings (for US keyboard layout) don't need a numeric keypad.
If you have one, read SpeakupDesktopKeys instead, easier to follow,
especially if you use another keyboard layout than US.

The CapsLock key acts like a Shift key. For instance, "CapsLock 4" means
Ins 2 means "hold down the CapsLock key like a shift key and press 2".
Keep numlock off to use Speakup. 

Scope: these key bindings can be used with hard synthesizers and with
espeakup, and also with speechd-up. However setting the pitch or the
speech volume using key bindings is not available when using speechd-up. 

First keys to remember:
PrintScreen          Toggle speakup on/off 
CapsLock F1          Speakup Help (press Space to exit) 

Key allowing to change settings:
CapsLock 1/2         Decrease/Increase the sound volume
CapsLock 3/4         Decrease/increase the pitch
CapsLock 5/6         Decrease/Increase the speech rate
CapsLock F9/F10      Decrease/Increase the punctuation level
CapsLock F11/F12     Decrease/Increase the reading punctuation

These settings can be saved typing as root:
speakup-save
The settings for a hard synthesizer, speechd-up or espeakup are saved
separately as they can differ.

Then they will be restored at next start of espeakup, speechd-up or at
next boot for a hard synthesizer.

If you don't to want to restore the saved settings, type as root:
chmod -x /usr/sbin/speakup-restore 

If you the have them restored again type as root:
chmod +x /usr/sbin/speakup-restore
