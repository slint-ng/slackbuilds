WARNING (seems obsolete as of version 1.26.1)

Building this package needs three steps:
1) run "fakeroot slkbuild"
This writes ./mate-user-guide.sh

2) Edit  mate-user-guide.sh to remove these lines:

export CFLAGS="-O2 -march=noarch"
export CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=noarch"
export SLKCFLAGS="-O2 -march=noarch"

Else ./autogen.sh fails during the build.

3) run "fakeroot sh mate-user-guide.sh"
This actually builds the package

yelp-tools and yelp-xsl are build dependencies of this package
