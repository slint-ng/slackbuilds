This package provides shells scripts written by Ruarí Ødegaard to download,
build and install or upgrade packages of the latest stable version of the web
browsers Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Vivaldi and of Mozilla Thunderbird

To install one of these applications, type as root:
latest <application>
replacing <browser> by chrome, firefox, vivaldi or thunderbird.

Then the package will be built, stored in /tmp and installed. You will be asked
if you want to keep it there, the default answer is no.

The latest stable release of the browser will be installed.

If you install firefox or thunderbird:
1. Start it the first time after installation typing:
firefox -P
or
thunderbird P
and select the profile you were using before installation.
2. As another version is included in Slint, after installation the script will
propose you to blacklist mozilla-firefox and mozilla-thunderbird in
/etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc if not yet done. The default answer is yes.

Note.

In case you downgrade Thuderbird and seem to loose lighting (the calendar), read:
