New users should simply run "notmuch" to be guided
through the process of configuring notmuch and creating
a database of existing email messages. The "notmuch"
command will also offer some sample search commands.

Beyond the command-line interface, notmuch also offers
a full-featured interface for reading and writing mail
within emacs. To use this, each user should add the
following line to the ~/.emacs file:

	(require 'notmuch)

And then run emacs as "emacs -f notmuch" or invoke
the command "M-x notmuch" from within emacs.
