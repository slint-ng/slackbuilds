# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pyparsing3.11: pyparsing3.11 (parsing module for python)
pyparsing3.11:
pyparsing3.11: The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
pyparsing3.11: executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or
pyparsing3.11: the use of regular expressions. The pyparsing3.11 module provides a
pyparsing3.11: library of classes that client code uses to construct the grammar
pyparsing3.11: directly in Python code.
