Features
Here are some of them (listed by the incomplete Readme):

     open files in CLI or GUI based on mime types
     tab navigation
     context menu
     search
     Type ahead
     simple keybindings (similar to GUI file managers)
     history tracking
     favorites
     compress / decompress
     flexible plugin architecture

     goto [root,home,location]

Aaand the most important, completely screen reader friendly. no overlays, no strange pseudo UI elements, no overlapping areas and proper cursor placement (no heigleight racking or any other magic required).

There might be hidden bugs. If you find some, i promise to fix them up to have an awesome easy to use accessible alternative command line file manager.  But it is used currently by a small user base for a while without bigger issues. So i think its worth a try :)!
